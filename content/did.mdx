# What is DID?

Dissociative Identity Disorder is a condition that causes a person to have two or more distinct personalities. It develops due to trauma that the person experiences. It started as Multiple Personality Disorder, but is no longer used medically. There is no cure for DID.

      <DefinitionItem summary="A voice in your head">
        DID is more than a voice in your head. It’s more of someone in your head, who is
        different from you, who can take control of one’s body.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Quirky">
        DID is not something quirky or something to be proud of. It causes the person
        significant stress and worry.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Something to joke about">
        While some people have another personality that is fine and harmless, others
        aren't, and joking or making fun of them can be dangerous.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="A choice">
        People with DID didn’t choose to have it and are often worried about what might
        cause the other person to come out again.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Acting like someone else for attention">
        People with DID don’t have a choice over when they disasociate.

      <DefinitionItem summary="One or more distinct personalities">
        There are one or more distinct personalities one has that can come and go as they
        wish. They can appear at any time and disappear at any time, though they tend to
        come out when the person would’ve a flashback.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Serious and life changing">
        Being that the person isn’t always in control, it can cause them to worry about
        when the other personality could come out. It adds extra stress, and this can
        worsen things.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Forced upon the person">
        A person develops DID due to trauma. So sexual abuse and physical abuse can lead
        to the development of DID, as it allows the person to either not deal with the
        memories or not have to be abused.

## Common behaviours

The following are some common behaviours for people with DID. They do not apply to all people, as the condition is individual and varies from person to person.

<Definition>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Inability to remember significant parts of childhood">
    People with DID often tend to not remember parts of their childhood, whether
    or not their trauma was part of their childhood.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Unexplained events and inability to be aware of them">
    Sometimes they find themselves in situations they don’t remember getting
    into or finding something that happened they don’t remember happening. For
    example, you find a shirt in your closet you don’t remember getting.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Frequent bouts of memory loss or “lost time”">
    The person often finds themselves where time simply vanishes during the day.
    Where one moment it’s 9:30 in the morning, and while they weren’t
    distracting themselves, it’s suddenly 10:00 in the morning.

    talking to them, or the voice is in their head.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Suicide attempts or self injury">

## Why should I care?

DID is sometimes boiled down to things it is not, this is harmful for these reasons.

- It changes the definition of what this mental illness is in the public, which leads to people believing they have it when they don’t.
- It waters down how serious a mental illness it is.
- It makes it harder to diagnose those who actually have it.

## What can I do?

1. **Spread awareness.** Correct people who incorrectly use DID by saying inaccurate things or joking about it. Send them this page!

2. **Support groups for DID.** There are many organizations that raise money to support people with DID and their families. Even if you can’t support yourself, you can help share these groups with others, so they can support these groups.
