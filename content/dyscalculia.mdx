        Dyscalcualia fundamentally makes it harder to do certain things. It is not
        something that can be overcome with sheer will.

      <DefinitionItem summary="A joke or meme">
        Dyscalculia isn't something to take lightly. It affects the lives of those with it
        in a negative way. Joking or spreading memes is disrespectful of those suffering.

      <DefinitionItem summary="“Math dyslexia”">
        While Dyscalculia can make it harder to perceive a value while looking at numbers,
        it should not be compared to Dyslexia.

        Things taken for granted, like reading a clock, are harder than for most people.
        Other parts of society not well adapted for people with Dyscaluclia are also
        harder, with school being a notable example.{" "}

  <DefinitionItem summary="Difficulty doing math">
    People with Dyscalculia have a harder time recognizing and understanding numbers. They
    can lose track while counting or need longer time for tasks considered simple for
    others. This puts them at a disadvantage.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Harder to determine between left and right">
    Dyscalculia makes determining between left and right confusing. Both in terms of
    understanding when others say either, and when planning in the mind.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Difficulty budgeting and keeping track of money">
    Tasks such as estimating the cost of the items in a shopping basket or budgeting are
    significantly harder.

## What can I do?

1. **Stop teasing people about not being able to do things you think are easy.** People with Dyscalculia do not always have the same ability to do some things.

2. **Spread awareness!** When you find someone with an incorrect definition of Dyscalculia, send them this page.

3. **Support groups for Dyscalculia.** There are many organizations that raise money to support people with Dyscalculia and their families. Even if you can’t support yourself, you can help share these groups with others, so they can support these groups.
