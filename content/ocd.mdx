# What is OCD?

Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a conditon that makes people do actions (compulsions) or think about things (obesssions) involuntarily. This happens repeatedly and without choice.

        OCD is a mental condition. It's disrespectful to joke or spread memes about it.

        Feeling upset when something is not aligned correctly is human, not having OCD.

        People can't be "OCD". It's a mental condition, you either have it or you don't.

      <DefinitionItem summary="Quirky">
        OCD is not quirky. It is a mental condition that you don't want to have.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Always visible">
        Compulsions are sometimes in a person's head, possibly invisible to others. They
        still take up considerable time and can cause a lot of anxiety, often resulting in
        the person being constantly distracted, restless and on edge.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="A choice">
        We all have things we choose to obsess over. We might rewrite a message to make it
        just right or replay a moment in our heads multiple times. But someone with OCD
        cannot "snap out of it". They feel like there is nothing they can do but continue
        thinking about it. The brain is stuck and driven by anxiety.

        Having OCD means that you feel like you have no option but to do something that
        you do not find logical or have any pleasure doing.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Time-consuming">
        Dealing with OCD means that time you would rather spend on other things must
        instead be spent managing your symptoms. The criteria for being diagnosed with OCD
        includes a requirement that it takes up at least 1 hour of your day.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Unwanted">
        OCD is not something to be jealous of. Everyone with OCD wishes that they didn't
        have it.

## Common behaviours

The following are some common behaviors for people with OCD. They do not apply to all people, as the condition is individual and varies from person to person.

<Definition>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Obsessions">
    1. “Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges or images that are experienced, at some
    time during the disturbance, as intrusive, unwanted, and that in most individuals
    cause marked anxiety or distress.”

    2. “The individual attempts to ignore or suppress
    such thoughts, urges, or images, or to neutralize them with some thought or action
    (i.e., by performing a compulsion).”

  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Compulsions">
    1. “Repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering checking) or mental acts (e.g.,
    praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the person feels driven to perform
    in response to an obsession, or according to the rules that must be applied rigidly.”

    2. “The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or
    preventing some dreaded event or situation. However, these behaviors or mental acts
    either are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize
    or prevent or are clearly excessive.”

## Why should I care?

Talking about or mentioning OCD as the reason for you being annoyed about something **spreads an incorrect definition.** This is bad for multiple reasons:

- It trivializes the condition by making it seem less painful than it is, **invalidating** the experience for people suffering from it.
- It makes it harder for people suffering to **get diagnosed.**
- It's disrespectful for people with OCD.

## What can I do?

1.  **Avoid using the word OCD for things that have nothing to do with the actual condition.** Here are some examples of phrases that should be avoided:

    <QuoteGroup>
      <Quote>I'm so OCD</Quote>
      <Quote>That is triggering my OCD</Quote>
      <Quote>My OCD can't handle this</Quote>
      <Quote>_ is giving me an OCD attack</Quote>
      <Quote>I'm so OCD about that</Quote>
    </QuoteGroup>

2.  **Stop spreading and endorsing jokes/memes about OCD.** The vast majority of them are disrespectful to people suffering.

3.  **Spread awareness instead!** The next time you hear a joke or incorrect use, speak up and link them to this website or other excellent [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXx20g2Poe8) and [articles](https://iocdf.org/blog/2013/03/01/5-things-ocd-is-not/).
