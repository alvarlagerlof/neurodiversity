    ## Common symptoms

    The following are some common behaviors for people with Dyslexia. They do not apply to all people, as the condition is individual and varies from person to person.

    <Definition>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Having a hard time reading">
        Reading large blocks of text can be challenging with Dyslexia. Letters seem to mold
        together and accidentally reading the same line is common. Learning to read is also
        harder.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Difficulty spelling">
        Spelling can be harder due to how the brain processes what words sound like. The brain
        cannot break down a word into parts.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Trouble forming clear sentences">
        Forming clear and simple sentence structures may be harder.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Mispronouncing words">
        Pronouncing a word incorrectly even after multiple attempts to say it right is more
        common with Dyslexia.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Difficulty understanding idioms">
        Understanding jokes and expressions involving idioms or things otherwise not clear in
        plain sight may be harder.

    ## What can I do?

    1. **Stop joking about Dyslexia.** These jokes and memes are often insensitive and hurtful to people with the condition. By joking, you’re spreading misinformation and disrespecting people with Dyslexia.

    2. **Spread awareness.** Next time you hear a person using the word Dyslexia incorrectly or having a stereotypical view of people with Dyslexia, send them this page.

    3. **Support groups for Dyslexia.** There are many organizations that raise money to support people with Dyslexia and their families. Even if you can’t support yourself, you can help share these groups with others, so they can support these groups.
