      <DefinitionItem summary="Anxiety (the emotion)">
        Anxiety is an emotion that many people typically experience. An anxiety disorder
        makes someone experience anxiety beyond normal levels. However, someone diagnosed
        with an anxiety disorder may say they “have anxiety” for convenience.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Just nervousness or shyness">
        Someone with anxiety disorder usually experiences anxiety at much greater levels
        compared to a neurotypical person in the same situation.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Simply being worried">
        People with anxiety disorders can feel anxious even for no particular reason, in a
        situation with no stressors at all.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="A temporary ailment that can be waited out">
        Anxiety disorders do not go away on their own without professional treatment, and
        may in fact worsen.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Always visible">
        It’s not always obvious if someone has an anxiety disorder, because they may have
        their stress episodes in private, or they have learned ways to manage their
        anxiety levels, or they have coped by hiding their emotions well.
      </DefinitionItem>
    </Definition>

  right={
    <Definition>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Treatable or manageable">
        Depending on the person, anti-anxiety medication, effective coping strategies, or
        psychotherapeutic methods like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help them
        manage their anxiety effectively. This can be complemented with healthy eating and
        regular exercise to further reduce anxiety levels.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Present in both children and adults">
        Anyone can be potentially diagnosed with an anxiety disorder regardless of age.

  ## Common symptoms

The following are some common symptoms for people with some form of anxiety disorder. They do not apply to all people, as the condition is individual and varies from person to person.

  <Definition>
    <DefinitionItem summary="Increased heart rate">
      Because people with anxiety are stressed, the person's heart rate increases. This
      can cause even more stress on them and cause the other symptoms to be worse.
    </DefinitionItem>
    <DefinitionItem summary="Cold sweats">
      Because people with anxiety are under stress, and also because their heart rate may
      be higher, they can start to sweat. No matter where they are, the temperature, or
      other outside influences, they may start sweating.
    </DefinitionItem>
    <DefinitionItem summary="Trembling">
      Also affected by the increased heart rate, but not only because of it, people with
      anxiety can start trembling. They may have a shaky voice, shaky hands, or some other
      parts of their body shake.
    </DefinitionItem>
    <DefinitionItem summary="Difficulty focusing">
      Due to the amount of stress the person with anxiety disorder has, whether it be due
      to one big thing or several smaller things, they cannot help but focus on whatever
      is causing their anxiety. This makes it harder to focus on important day-to-day
      things, which then may cause more anxiety.
    </DefinitionItem>
    <DefinitionItem summary="Loss of appetite">
      Anxiety can cause a loss of appetite or repulsion to eating. To distinguish this
      from anorexia, this is largely caused by feelings of fear triggered within a person
      undergoing anxiety.
    </DefinitionItem>
    <DefinitionItem summary="Hyperventilation">
      A person who has anxiety may start having rapid or deep breathing. This can be
      caused from anxiety or panic, but is more likely to happen to a person who has an
      anxiety disorder.
    </DefinitionItem>
    <DefinitionItem summary="Stomach problems">
      Anxiety can actually affect the gut negatively, leading to indigestion or acid
      reflux. Hyperventilation from anxiety may also lead to swallowing of air, causing
      bloating in the stomach.
    </DefinitionItem>
    <DefinitionItem summary="Tense / aching muscles">
      Someone experiencing immense anxiety may involuntarily clench their fists, feet,
      jaws, or any muscles for longer periods than normal, leading to tension and aches.
    </DefinitionItem>
    <DefinitionItem summary="Sense of impending danger / panic / doom">
      A person with an anxiety disorder may feel immense dread or panic even when there is
      nothing present that is genuinely life-threatening.
    </DefinitionItem>
    <DefinitionItem summary="Sleep deprivation">
      A person with an anxiety disorder may experience sleep deprivation, as their anxiety
      may cause problems with trying to fall asleep or stay asleep.
    </DefinitionItem>
    <DefinitionItem summary="Suicidal ideation">
      An underdiscussed symptom of anxiety is suicidal ideation. In cases of severe
      anxiety, symptoms can reach a tipping point in which suicidal thoughts or ideation
      occur. This can also be caused by a comorbidity with depression.

## What can I do?

1. **Stop joking about anxiety disorders.** These jokes and memes are often insensitive and hurtful to people with the condition. By joking, you’re spreading misinformation and disrespecting people with anxiety disorders.

2. **Spread awareness.** Next time you hear a person misusing the word “anxiety”, conflating “anxiety” with “anxiety disorder”, or having a stereotypical view of people with anxiety disorders, send them this page.

3. **Support groups for anxiety.** There are many organizations that raise money to support people with anxiety disorders and their families. Even if you can’t support yourself, you can help share these groups with others, so they can support these groups.
