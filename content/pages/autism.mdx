      <DefinitionItem summary="Simply a superpower">
        Some people believe abilities common with Autistic people give them an
        advantage in certain situations. But calling autism a superpower, you
        also disregard some harder parts of the condition.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="An illness">
        Autism is not an illness. It is a different way for the brain to
        function.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Low or high-functioning">
        While low and high-functioning labels may appear beneficial at first, it
        is one of the primary ways to get help. For example, low-functioning may
        get much more help and support due to the more visible need for help.
        But high-functioning people may suffer just as much, but are simply
        better at hiding it.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Always visible">
        It may not be obvious that a person is Autistic. They may be hiding it
        to “fit in”. Some people can learn to hide it or control it to the point
        it seems like their personality.

        Since 2013, Aspergers is considered to be a part of the autism spectrum

      <DefinitionItem summary="Different for everyone">
        Sometimes described as a spectrum, being autistic is not something you
        are more or less of. There are instead many symptoms that may show up
        more or less.This means there are infinite ways a person can be
        autistic.

## Common behaviors

The following are some common behaviors for Autistic people. They do not apply to all people, as the condition is individual and varies from person to person.

<Definition>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Eye contact is unpleasant">
    For autistic people, the brain uses more energy processing facial
    expressions than normal. This can make eye contact unpleasant or even
    painful. The behavior is even observed in babies. Not looking into eyes also
    has the effect of people presuming you are uninterested or distant.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Social signals are not intuitive">
    Things like irony, jokes and riddles may not be intuitive to the same level
    as for non-autistic people. This forces the brain to figure things out in
    manual ways, requiring much more energy.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Things are interpreted literally">
    There is a tendency for autistic people to interpret things exactly as they
    are said, instead of what they suggest. Asking “can you open the window?”
    may result in a “yes”, followed by the person not opening the window. They
    can open the window, but they don’t realize they’re being asked to do so.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Recognizing details rather than the whole picture">
    Autistic people often have an easier time focusing on details, rather than
    the bigger picture. This has benefits when digging deep into a topic, but is
    unhelpful when it comes to quickly assessing a situation.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Non-verbal">
    Some Autistic people may be non-verbal. This means they cannot speak, but
    that doesn’t mean they cannot think or feel just as you or me. Some Autistic
    people are verbal under usual conditions, but lose the ability when under
    stress
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Hypersensitivity">
    Senses can be overwhelming and overpowered. In conversation, an autistic
    person may have trouble tuning out the background noise and focusing on the
    person/group they are talking to. Things like bright lights, touch and smell
    may also be felt more intensely.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Social situations are draining">
    Due to the behaviors mentioned above, an autistic person may have to spend
    significantly more energy than their peers in social situations.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Masking">
    Some autistic people realize their behaviors aren’t perceived as “normal”.
    If this happens, they may start studying how to “act normal”. Successfully,
    this may make their autism invisible to others. This constant acting is
    draining, leaving them exhausted after social situations.
