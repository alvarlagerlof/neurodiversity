        Dyscalcualia fundamentally makes it harder to do certain things. It is
        not something that can be overcome with sheer will.

      <DefinitionItem summary="A joke or meme">
        Dyscalculia isn't something to take lightly. It affects the lives of
        those with it in a negative way. Joking or spreading memes is
        disrespectful of those suffering.

      <DefinitionItem summary="“Math dyslexia”">
        While Dyscalculia can make it harder to perceive a value while looking
        at numbers, it should not be compared to Dyslexia.

        Things taken for granted, like reading a clock, are harder than for most
        people. Other parts of society not well adapted for people with
        Dyscaluclia are also harder, with school being a notable example.{" "}

    considered simple for others. This puts them at a disadvantage.

    terms of understanding when others say either, and when planning in the
    mind.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Difficulty budgeting and keeping track of money">
    Tasks such as estimating the cost of the items in a shopping basket or
    budgeting are significantly harder.

## What can I do?

1. **Stop teasing people about not being able to do things you think are easy.** People with Dyscalculia do not always have the same ability to do some things.

2. **Spread awareness!** When you find someone with an incorrect definition of Dyscalculia, send them this page.

3. **Support groups for Dyscalculia.** There are many organizations that raise money to support people with Dyscalculia and their families. Even if you can’t support them yourself, you can help share these groups with others, so they can support these groups.
