# What is Bipolar Disorder?

Bipolar disorder is a condition affecting the chemical balance in the brain, that primarily makes it shift between episodes of “up” (feeling energetic) or “down” (feeling depressed). While it is a life-long condition that is not curable, it can be treated effectively with the right medication.

        Bipolar episodes happen whether wanted or not. The risk for developing bipolar
        disorder is mainly due to genetics, however the exact mechanism is yet unknown.
        Environmental and social factors may also have a large impact, especially if there
        is an underlying genetic risk.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Always based on what happens in the surrounding environment">
        Anyone can feel sad when something bad happens to them, as well as feeling good
        when they achieve something. Both are moods as a result of an event. For people
        with bipolar disorder, there is a risk that life events might heighten or deepen
        an ongoing episode, but episodes may also happen without a triggering event.

      <DefinitionItem summary="Fun">
        Being manic or hypomanic is sometimes described as the best thing in the world.
        Having the energy to do things and meet people might seem fantastic, but bipolar
        disorder also comes with depression.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Curable">
        While bipolar disorder can be managed using medicine and various other treatments,
        it cannot be cured.

      <DefinitionItem summary="Debilitating">
        Being bipolar and not getting treated for it can significantly ruin things like
        school and work. Manic symptoms such as lack of impulse control often lead to
        financial and physically dangerous behavior. With depression often comes low self
        esteem and the feeling of being worthless, which can affect a bipolar person's
        focus and social abilities. In severe cases depression might lead to suicidal
        thoughts or attempts.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Sometimes dangerous if untreated">
        Bipolar persons can pose many forms of danger to themselves during episodes due to
        impulsive behavior. During (hypo)mania the person may overspend, engage in
        dangerous activities, have delusions or psychosis. During a depressive episode the
        person can be dangerous towards their own health.

## States of bipolar disorder

These are the different states of bipolar disorder. Together, the form they types listed in the next section.

<Definition>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Mania">
    During mania, the brain is very active. The person might feel euphoric and creative,
    but also comes with a risk of reckless or impulsive behavior with symptoms listed
    below. There is also a risk for psychosis. Doing mentally and physically intensive
    tasks on low or no sleep can be possible.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Hypomania">
    Hypomania is where the brain is at a hyperactive state. Emotions, physical sensations,
    and energy are intensified as the need for sleep decreases. Racing thoughts and
    grandiose delusions often lead to the setting of arbitrary goals, impulsive purchases,
    and/or dangerous behavior. Being overly talkative is also common.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Depression">
    Bipolar depression is a state that typically follows (hypo)mania. It also may come
    suddenly or slowly develop after a period of euthymia. It can be debilitating to a
    large degree and significantly decrease the ability to function. Work and school may
    become impossible.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Euthymia">
    Euthymia is a somewhat stable state without depression or mania/hypomania. It is the
    target state when medicating. It does not, however, feel like “normal” for a
    non-bipolar person.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Mixed states">
    Mixed states is when symptoms of both depression and (hypo)mania are present. The
    person may shift from one state to another rapidly or exhibit both symptoms
    simultaneously.
  </DefinitionItem>

## Types of bipolar disorder

The different types of bipolar disorder are a combination of the above states.

<Definition>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Bipolar 1">
    Consists of mania, hypomania, mixed states, euthymia and depression.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Bipolar 2">
    Consists of hypomania, mixed states, euthymia and depression.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Cyclothymia">
    The symptoms of cyclothymia are milder than bipolar disorder, but also concern
    feelings of emotional lows and highs. Since the symptoms are mild, cyclothymia is
    often undiagnosed and untreated, but the mood swings might still affect social and
    professional life.

## Common symptoms

The following are some common symptoms for people with some form of anxiety disorder. They do not apply to all people, as the condition is individual and varies from person to person.

<Definition>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Impulsivity">
    Manic episodes can lead to more impulsive spending, unsafe sexual behaviour and more.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Restlessness">
    Restlessness is a feeling of always needing to do something. This can happen during
    manic or hypomanic episodes. It often needs to be high-energy or mentally demanding.
    Doing nothing or something calm feels impossible.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Insomnia">
    Insomnia is not being able to sleep despite wanting to and feeling tired. This can
    happen in all states.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Eating too much or too little">
    Mania/hypomania and depression can both affect appetite and feeling of hunger.
    Medication for bipolar disorder might also affect the appetite.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Paranoia">
    Bipolar persons might get paranoid. They can feel like someone is out to get them, or
    following them, for example.{" "}
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Suicidal thoughts">
    Suicidal thoughts, attempts and deaths are all more common with bipolar disorder.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Euphoria">
    During hypomania or mania, a person might feel euphoric. Everything feels great and
    all worries disappear. The feeling is, however, not based in reality, as the symptom
    causes the person to look overly positively at the world.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Overconfidence">
    With hypomania or mania, an increased sense of confidence or self-worth can happen.
    This again is not completely based in reality, but rather how the bipolar person
    perceives the world and how chemistry in the brain works.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Psychosis">
    During mania, psychosis may occur. It can involve auditory and visual hallucinations,
    where someone may see or hear things that are not there. There may also be the
    presence of delusions.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Gambling or overspending">
    A bipolar person in both high and low states has higher risk of spending too much
    money on unnecessary or risky investments or things.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Hypersexuality">
    During mania or hypomania primarily, a bipolar person may experience a stronger sexual
    drive than usual.{" "}
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Self-harm">
    Self-harm is more common with bipolar disorder. It may arise as a coping mechanism for
    other symptoms.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Intrusive thoughts">
    A common thing to have alongside bipolar disorder is OCD. The symptoms of OCD such as
    intrusive thoughts and compulsions may get worse with certain states of bipolar
    disorder.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Prone to accidents">
    People experiencing mania or hypomania are more likely to find themselves in
    accidents. This can be due to poor risk perception or overconfidence, with the person
    believing they can do things they cannot.
  </DefinitionItem>
