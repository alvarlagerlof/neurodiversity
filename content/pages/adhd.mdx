      <DefinitionItem summary="Being lazy">
        People with ADHD have what is known as an interest based nervous system, where
        they are motivated by novelty, challenge, urgency and interest. This may make
        doing things they are unmotivated by harder.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Not trying hard enough">
        Trying is what people with ADHD do all the time, they just get interrupted by how
        their bodies and brain work more often than normal people.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Never being able to focus">
        People with ADHD can sometimes focus on one thing longer than people without ADHD.
        This is called hyperfocus and may arise when the person with ADHD is motivated.

      <DefinitionItem summary="Difficult">
        Undiagnosed ADHD or without proper support are at risk of systematically lower
        scores in school. The daily burden is simply larger.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Stressful">
        The Hyperactive Impulsive type of ADHD means always being on the move and doing
        things. It is hard to properly rest. This can stress up the body.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Uneven ability to focus">
        Having ADHD means that focus does not always work to the person’s benefit. The
        person might have a lot of trouble focusing on something they find unmotivating,
        while having no problem at all focusing for hours on things that they find
        interesting.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Impairing">
        ADHD makes it difficult to begin and finish tasks. Household and personal care may
        be constantly pushed off due to executive dysfunction, and the build-up of tasks
        may easily overwhelm the person.

## Types of ADHD

Previously there was a diagnosis called ADD. It was like ADHD, but without the hyperactive and impulsive parts. Later, it was combined into ADHD and clear types were defined. The type is not static, but can slightly change over a lifetime.

<Definition>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Inattentive">
    Previously called ADD, this type is lacking the impulsive and hyperactive traits. What
    is still there is difficulty filtering and focusing.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Hyperactive Impulsive">
    A person with Hyperactive Impulsive ADHD is likely to act before they think. This is
    shown in several ways such as doing or saying something that they would not have done
    if they were thinking about it beforehand.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Combined">
    The combined type of ADHD is having traits from both the inattentive and the
    Hyperactive Impulsive types.

## Common symptoms

The following are some common symptoms for people with ADHD. They do not apply to all people, as the condition is individual and varies from person to person.

<Definition>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Executive dysfunction">
    Things like organization, planning, following plans and keeping track of items may be
    harder with ADHD. Having problems with doing essential things such as cleaning can
    occur due to having a harder time doing things without motivation. Following step-by
    step guides especially when heard verbally can be difficult.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Emotional dysregulation">
    People with ADHD tend to experience emotions more vividly. This is due to the deficits
    in regulation of the areas of the brain involved in filtering emotional responses.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Difficulty with filtering">
    Everyone is being bombarded by colors, lights, sights, sounds. While this is fine for
    those without ADHD, those with it can’t filter between what is needed and what is not.
    This makes focusing on everyday tasks harder.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Poor working memory">
    People with ADHD may have a harder time transfering new information (or the right
    information) into working memory, resulting in what looks like poor working memory
    regarding a certain task.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Losing focus quickly">
    A common symptom is focus that lasts too short of time or keeps jumping to new things
    all the time. This is related to the difficulty with filtering mentioned above.
  </DefinitionItem>

## What can I do?

1. **Stop joking about ADHD** These jokes and memes are often insensitive and hurtful to people with the condition. By joking, you’re spreading misinformation and disrespecting people with ADHD.

2. **Spread awareness.** Next time you hear a person using ADHD incorrectly or having a stereotypical view of people with ADHD, send them this page.

3. **Support groups for ADHD.** There are many organizations that raise money to support people with ADHD and their families. Even if you can’t support them yourself, you can help share these groups with others, so they can support these groups.
