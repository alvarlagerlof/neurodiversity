      <DefinitionItem summary="Simply a superpower">
        Some people believe abilities common with autism give them an advantage in certain
        situations. But calling autism a superpower, you also disregard some harder parts
        of the condition.

      <DefinitionItem summary="An illness">
        Autism is not an illness. It is a different way for the brain to function.

      <DefinitionItem summary="Low or high-functioning">
        While low and high-functioning labels may appear beneficial at first, it is one of
        the primary ways to get help. For example, low-functioning may get much more help
        and support due to the more visible need for help. But high-functioning people may
        suffer just as much, but are simply better at hiding it.
      </DefinitionItem>
      <DefinitionItem summary="Always visible">
        It may not be obvious that a person is Autistic. They may be hiding it to “fit
        in”. Some people can learn to hide it or control it to the point it seems like
        their personality.

      <DefinitionItem summary="Different for everyone">
        Sometimes described as a spectrum, being autistic is not something you are more or
        less of. There are instead many symptoms that may show up more or less.This means
        there are infinite ways a person can be autistic.

## Common behaviors

The following are some common behaviors for people with autism. They do not apply to all people, as the condition is individual and varies from person to person.

<Definition>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Eye contact is unpleasant">
    For autistic people, the brain uses more energy processing facial expressions than
    normal. This can make eye contact unpleasant or even painful. The behavior is even
    observed in babies. Not looking into eyes also has the effect of people presuming you
    are uninterested or distant.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Social signals are not intuitive">
    Things like irony, jokes and riddles may not be intuitive to the same level as for
    non-autistic people. This forces the brain to figure things out in manual ways,
    requiring much more energy.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Things are interpreted literally">
    There is a tendency for autistic people to interpret things exactly as they are said,
    instead of what they suggest. Asking “can you open the window?” may result in a “yes”,
    followed by the person not opening the window. They can open the window, but they
    don’t realize they’re asked to do so.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Recognizing details rather than the whole picture">
    Autistic people often have an easier time focusing on details, rather than the bigger
    picture. This has benefits when digging deep into a topic, but is unhelpful when it
    comes to quickly assessing a situation.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Non-verbal">
    Some people with autism may be non-verbal. This means they cannot speak, but that
    doesn’t mean they cannot think or feel just as you or me. There are also Autisitc
    people who are verbal normally, but lose the ability when under stress.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Hypersensitivity">
    Senses can be overwhelming and overpowered. In conversation, an autistic person may
    have trouble tuning out the background noise and focusing on the person/group they are
    talking to. Things like bright lights, touch and smell may also be felt more
    intensely.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Social situations are draining">
    Due to the behaviors mentioned above, an autistic person may have to spend
    significantly more energy than their peers in social situations.
  </DefinitionItem>
  <DefinitionItem summary="Masking">
    Some autistic people realize their behaviors aren’t perceived as “normal”. If this
    happens, they may start studying how to “act normal”. Successfully, this may make
    their autism invisible to others. This constant acting is draining, leaving them
    exhausted after social situations.

## What can I do?

1. **Stop joking about autism.** These jokes and memes are often insensitive and hurtful to people with the condition. By joking, you’re spreading misinformation and disrespecting people with autism.

1. **Spread awareness.** Next time you hear a person using the word autistic incorrectly or having a stereotypical view of people with autism, send them this page.

1. **Support groups for autism.** There are many organizations that raise money to support autistic people and their families. Even if you can’t support yourself, you can help share these groups with others, so they can support these groups.
