# What is OCD?

You've most likely heard of it. However, **most people don't actually know what it is.** No worries! We’ll clear that up here.

OCD stands for **obsessive-compulsive disorder**. But what does that mean? OCD is [defined](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519704/table/ch3.t13) by the [DSM-5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5) as a presence of:

<Definition>
<DefinitionItem summary="Obsessions">

1. “Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges or images that are experienced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive, unwanted, and that in most individuals cause marked anxiety or distress.”
2. “The individual attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, urges, or images, or to neutralize them with some thought or action (i.e., by performing a compulsion).”

</DefinitionItem>
<DefinitionItem summary="Compulsions">

1. “Repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering checking) or mental acts (e.g., praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to the rules that must be applied rigidly.”
2. “The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation. However, these behaviors or mental acts either are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent or are clearly excessive.”

OCD is a mental disorder. It's disrespectful to joke or spread memes about
it.

<DefinitionItem summary="Being upset at asymmetrical things">

Feeling upset when something is not aligned correctly is human, not having
OCD.

<DefinitionItem summary="A personality type">
People can't be "OCD". It's a mental disorder, you either have it or you
don't.
</DefinitionItem>
<DefinitionItem summary="Quirky">
OCD is not quirky. It is a mental disorder that you don't want to have.
</DefinitionItem>
<DefinitionItem summary="A choice">
We all have things we choose to obsess over. We might rewrite a message to
make it just right or replay a moment in our heads multiple times. But
someone with OCD cannot "snap out of it". They feel like there is
nothing they can do but continue thinking about it. The brain is stuck and
driven by anxiety.

    <DefinitionItem summary="Taxing">Having OCD means that you feel like you have no option but to do something that you do not find logical or have any pleasure doing.</DefinitionItem>
    <DefinitionItem summary="Time-consuming">Dealing with OCD means that time you would rather spend on other things must instead be spent managing your symptoms. The criteria for being diagnosed with OCD includes a requirement that it takes up at least 1 hour of your day.</DefinitionItem>
    <DefinitionItem summary="Unwanted">OCD is not something to be jealous of. Everyone with OCD wishes that they didn't have it.</DefinitionItem>

## Why should I care?

Talking about or mentioning OCD as the reason for you being annoyed about something **spreads an incorrect definition.** This is bad for multiple reasons:

- It trivializes the condition by making it seem less painful than it is, **invalidating** the experience for people suffering from it.
- It makes it harder for people suffering to **get diagnosed.**
- It's disrespectful for people with OCD.

## What can I do?

1. **Avoid using the word OCD for things that aren't.** Here are some examples of phrases that should be avoided:

   <QuoteList
     quotes={[
       " I'm so OCD",
       "_ is triggering my OCD",
       "My OCD can't handle _",
       "_ is giving me an OCD attack",
       "I'm so OCD about _",
     ]}
   />

2. **Stop spreading and endorsing jokes/memes about OCD.** The vast majority of them are disrespectful to people suffering.
3. **Spread awareness instead!** The next time you hear a joke or incorrect use, speak up and link them to this website or other excellent [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXx20g2Poe8) and [articles](https://iocdf.org/blog/2013/03/01/5-things-ocd-is-not/).
