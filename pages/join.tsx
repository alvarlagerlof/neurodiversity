              First of all, thank you for considering us! We're a small community looking
              for more awesome people to join us.

                This website is created by people wanting to spread awareness about
                neurodiversity. We're everything from developers, parents, designers to
                journalists. To cover as many conditions as possible in a representative
                way, we need the perspective of many. Together, we can make a wiki that
                explains these conditions in a simple way for the general public.
              </Typography.Body>
              <Typography.Body>
                So with that said, any help is appreciated. While people who can write,
                code, design and organize are in need, that is not a requirement. Feedback
                and personal perspective is also very appreciated! If this is something
                that interests you, consider joining us.
