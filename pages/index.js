        <Heading.H2>Why?</Heading.H2>
        <Text>
          People often mention mental disabilities or make a joke without
          realizing how. By doing that they are hurting those who have the
          mental disabilities. By joking about it, you slowly change what people
          think when they hear the word, and that hurts the people who actually
          have the disability.

          Misinformation or little information is the cause. This site aims to
          combat this using easy-to-understand pages about various disabilities.
          With understanding, the hope is that that language can become more
          inclusive.

          The goal isn't medical accuracy. That would work inverserly to lose
          people reading beause of the complexity. The goal is to get people to
          rethink their definitions and consider how their languange is hurtful.
